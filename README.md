# Cerealizer

I was sitting in a meeting one day with a person named "Jason" and someone made a comment about whether or not they were `serialized`, which then turned into a joke about cereal.

So in the course of a meeting I put together a wrapper on top of the Newtonsoft.Json `JsonConvert` class that keeps all of the same functionality, but changes the word to `Cereal` instead of `Serial`.

It really provides no value other than that.
